# CirclularQueue usng Array
Here I have implimented the concepts of the circular Queues with the help of Arrays in c++ I have commented the  main logic in the programs 
first of all we  have created a class Queue which has the following atributes front,rear,size,*arr and in constructor of this class we have initiliaze all the attibutes then we have define the methods for the class the EnQueue(insertion),DeQueue(deletion),and display methods .
I have created a menu function to make it more understanble the menu funation will prompt the user to enter the size of the Queue and then Display the menu to user the and execute the code according to the user choices
